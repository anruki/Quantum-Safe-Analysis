# Quantum-Safe-Analysis
The present research project aims to analyze the impact of implementing post-quantum encryption mechanisms in business environments, assessing their feasibility, technical implications, and effects on security.
To carry out this study, post-quantum encryption algorithms standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) were implemented within the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, which enables encrypted communication between client and server.
The study includes the deployment of the necessary infrastructure to establish a client-server connection compatible with post-quantum algorithms. For this purpose, LibOQS tools were used, and all stages were documented to facilitate replication of the process and its future practical application.
The results show that post-quantum algorithms outperform traditional schemes such as RSA by offering greater resistance to quantum threats and improved efficiency. Therefore, organizations are advised to proactively adopt hybrid cryptographic solutions as a strategic step toward achieving security resilience in the quantum era.
